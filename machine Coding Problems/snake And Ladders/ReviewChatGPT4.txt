TLDR: Improve completeness, testing, edge case handling

Review
Structure & Organization: The code is well-structured with clear separation of concerns. Each entity (Snake, Ladder, Player) 
is encapsulated in its class, and utility functions are separated into a utils file.

Functionality: The main game loop correctly iterates over players, rolls the dice, moves the player, checks for snakes and 
ladders, and checks the win condition.

Input Handling: There is no code shown for handling input from the command line or a file. This is a critical part of the 
problem statement, and the absence of this functionality would be a significant omission.

Edge Cases: The code handles the basic edge cases such as not moving beyond position 100. However, it does not account for 
multiple snakes or ladders at the same position in one move, which the problem statement specifically asks to handle.

Rating (out of 10)
Code Quality: 8/10
Completeness: 6/10 (due to lack of input handling)
Efficiency: 9/10
Edge Cases: 7/10
Overall, the code demonstrates a strong grasp of the basic requirements but misses crucial input handling and some edge 
case considerations. I would rate it 7.5/10. For an SDE 1 role, this is a good attempt but needs more attention to 
completeness and edge case handling to be fully acceptable.


Here are several improvements that could be made to enhance the Snake and Ladder application:

Input Handling
Command Line or File Input: Implement input handling to read the number of snakes, ladders, and players from the command
line or a file. This would make the application more flexible and closer to the problem statement requirements.
Edge Case Handling
Chained Snakes and Ladders: Implement logic to handle cases where a player lands on the tail of a snake or the bottom of a 
ladder that leads directly to another snake or ladder.
Code Optimization and Structure
Modularization: Break down the main game loop into smaller, more manageable functions. This will make the code more readable 
and maintainable.

Configuration Validation: Add validation to ensure that snakes and ladders do not overlap incorrectly and follow the 
assumptions (e.g., no snake head at 100, no overlapping snakes and ladders).

Logging and Output: Enhance the logging mechanism to provide more detailed and structured outputs. For instance, logging 
the entire game state after each move can help in debugging and analyzing the game.

Testing
Unit Tests: Implement unit tests for all critical functions, including the movement logic, snake and ladder interactions, 
and win conditions. This ensures the robustness of the application.
Documentation
Code Documentation: Add comments and documentation to the code to explain the functionality of each part, especially complex 
logic. This helps other developers understand and maintain the code.
