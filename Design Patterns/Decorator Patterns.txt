- Decorators in JS is similar to annotations in java. 
- Usage of this Can be explained by taking an example of order creation for macbook, as there are many options, and the price
changes for each option, it would be very hard to check for each specific item and then update the price, instead using 
decorators we can just add that to the base class and update the price
- Abstract classes in TypeScript are base classes that cannot be instantiated directly. 
They are designed to be subclassed. Abstract classes can contain abstract methods, which are methods 
declared without implementation and must be implemented in derived classes.
