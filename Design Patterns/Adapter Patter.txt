- The adapter pattern allows you to make different classes with different interfaces work together, without changing their source code. 
- Took the example of iphone charger and android charger and making the iphone use microusb and lightining internally, to do this
create two interface for both iphone and android, and two classes that implement these interfaces and have two functions or multiple
like uselightining and use microusb respectively, now new adapter class created that implements the android interface and has a functions
useAdapterMicro and takes argument of iphone and in the function we use the uselightining function, could be more complex but this
is an easy example to understand this
